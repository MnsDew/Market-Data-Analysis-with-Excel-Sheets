# Market-Data-Analysis-with-Excel-Sheets
Market Data Analysis with Excel Sheets Overview This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing market data stored in Excel sheets. The scripts utilize the CSV library to read data from multiple Excel files and calculate statistics such as total occurrences, total amounts, and average amounts per occurrence for various products.  



Features
Data Parsing: Parses market data from Excel sheets using the CSV library.
Statistical Analysis: Calculates total occurrences, total amounts, and average amounts per occurrence for each product.

Support for Multiple Files: Handles data from multiple Excel sheets for comprehensive analysis.
Dynamic Product Handling: Dynamically identifies and analyzes different products present in the market data.
Usage

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the CSV library if not already installed: pip3 install csv.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Place your Excel sheet files (in CSV format) containing market data in the repository directory.
Update the csv_file1 and csv_file2 variables in the script with the names of your CSV files.
Run the Python script to analyze the market data and view the statistics for each product.

Example
Suppose you have two Excel sheets (excelsheet.csv and excelsheet2.csv) containing market data for fruits. The script will read the data from both files, calculate the total occurrences, total amounts, and average amounts per occurrence for each fruit, and display the results.
